Did by first Alfresco implementation in 2006. Loved the technology so much, I started by one man consulting gig called Zaizi in 2007. Today Zaizi is one of the biggest Alfresco partners in the world with the highest number Alfresco certified engineers outside of Alfresco. Alfresco EMEA Partner of the year 2012 & 2013. Sponsor and organise Alfresco London Meetup, Alfresco Seville Meetup and Content Management Meetup, Sri Lanka. Used to be active the Alfresco forums, but not enough time to help out as much when you are working on some of the largest Alfresco implementations.
