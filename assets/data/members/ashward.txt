I've been involved on-and-off with Alfresco development for a number of years in my current role at Surevine. Over those years I have been heavily involved in the development and deployment of a number of extensions for Alfresco, some open source and some currently in the process of being open sourced (see https://github.com/surevine/?query=alfresco ). I also presented at an Alfresco DevCon (when they were still called that) a few years back and earned myself a t-shirt! :)
