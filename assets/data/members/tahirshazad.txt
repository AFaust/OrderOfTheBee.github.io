Hi All!

I'm Tahir Shazad Malik, am been working very long on Alfresco as a Developer. Started with version 2.2. and am still going hard with the latest version.

The first 3 years with Alfresco I was working for a company, then I started my own firm. After my own firm I realized how important the community is. So then I started contributing as in Jira fixes, blogs and after a while on StackOverflow.
After the first Dashlet competition I started writing addons and pieces of code for Alfresco & the community.

Now a days I'm developing a lot of stuff, mainly custom modules and I try to blog once in a while.
I just took my eyes of Stack for a few months and see that Jeff has gained me with his stats: http://stackoverflow.com/tags/alfresco/topusers !

Below is a list of my Community contributions. I probably forgot a bunch, but thats OK.
