I am the Localisation Manager at Alfresco, managing the terminology and localisation of Alfresco products into the core official languages (French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Russian, Norwegian, Brazilian Portuguese and Simplified Chinese) .  The term lists and translation memories are available for members of the community upon request.
