I'm an Alfresco consultant working for the Alfresco partner Redpill Linpro in Sweden. I have been working with alfresco for a few years and I've always had much help from community at the forums and blog posts etc. I'm trying to answer questions on the forum when they are within my area of expertise. The main way I try to contribute to the community is by creating useful addons. 

Since 2013 I've been in charge of the open source project which supplies a simple way to integrate online editing with LibreOffice from Alfresco Share.

Since this year I'm also involved in the translation project at crowdin where I together with other people translate Alfresco + RM into swedish. 

When working with new clients in my work I always try to find parts of the work that could be useful for other people. I have created some repos on github where such content has been published. So far most of it is without documentation, but that will follow when time allows. 

With a membership in the order I hope to find new ways to help in the community.
