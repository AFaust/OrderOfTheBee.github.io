I am a CTO of yanado.com a great task management tool that lives inside Gmail. Also a alfresco developer for 5 years, implementing alfresco in companies, maintaining and developing new features for clients. Recently I have started a blog called alfrescoBlog.com and my latest feature is email tracking inside alfresco, like yesware or getSignals is.
