I have been working with Alfresco for quite some time, started my first projects about 6 years ago. My community related work includes a few add-ons (most work with https://code.google.com/p/alfresco-metadata-writer/ ) and I have also arranged several community meetups in the Nordic region. By various means I have contributed to the translations of Alfresco to Swedish, Norwegian and Danish. I also do some blogging on http://alfresco.blog.redpill-linpro.com/ when time allows.
