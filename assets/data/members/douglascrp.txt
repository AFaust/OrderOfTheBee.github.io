I've helped on the Alfresco pt_BR translation, on the Share Site Logo Customisation addon (http://addons.alfresco.com/addons/share-site-logo-customisation) 4.2 port.
I watch almost all the Alfresco's hangouts, and usually try to make questions that I think are important.
And I try to be online at IRC most of the time, and try to help when I know/can.

Ah, and I think I can say I've kind of helped to set up the Order... (at least I tried to express my opinion on some questions)
