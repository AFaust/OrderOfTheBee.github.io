I've been working with Alfresco since 2008 (started with Alfresco CE 2.1.0) and keep working as a contractor at the moment. 

I've been around the forums (English and Spanish) since I first got my hands in Alfresco (fstnboy and amandaluniz_z are my accounts). I've also started a blog with friend Benjamin Chevallereau (www.bataon.com), but has been quiet lately.
