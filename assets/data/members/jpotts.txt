Former Alfresco Chief Community Officer. Wrote the Alfresco Developer Guide. Every now and then I blog at ecmarchitect.com where you can get tips, tricks, and tutorials for Alfresco. Have been working with Alfresco since its first release and continue to do so for clients around the world. Looking forward to helping ensure the software continues to be the world's leading open source ECM platform.
