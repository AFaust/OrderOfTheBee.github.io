				<p>The Spanish National Library decided to deal with the document management issue in 2010. It is paradoxical that a cultural institution comprised of librarians and other information experts had never addressed the complexity of their document management problem. But the librarians were much more worried about their collections than the documents they produced in exercising their functions. :)</p>
				<p>The project began with a consulting engagement with the goal of defining plans, policies, and procedures around document management. Two years later we decided which software would be the best choice to support our Document Management requirements. Two important criteria for us were open source and ECM market recognition. So we chose Alfresco.</p>
				<p>One of our requirements was that Alfresco should be integrated into the Corporate Intranet because we wanted our staff to have a unique corporate platform to access their corporate knowledge. And also because we care about user experience. These requirements helped us to minimize the impact of the change.</p>
				<p>So we use Alfresco to support the Document Management System here in the Spanish National Library.</p>
				<p>At present, 32% of the staff uses Alfresco. Alfresco Share is improving our working groups. The most interesting feature for us is the ability to create workflows because they help working groups have fewer meetings and to work better toward their objectives.</p>
				<p>The problems we faced with Alfresco are related to its usability. In most cases, we see that users don’t find Alfresco as intuitive or easy-to-use as we would like. So there is a big need for training employees.</p>
				<p>We hope that Alfresco will improve usability so that it will become a much more people-centered tool.</p>
				<p>I think that the level of use of Alfresco in Spanish National Library is very satisfactory and I hope we will extend our Alfresco implementation to the rest of the staff soon.</p>
