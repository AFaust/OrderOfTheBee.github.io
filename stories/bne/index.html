				<p>The Spanish National Library decided to deal with the document management issue in 2010. It is paradoxical that a cultural institution comprised of librarians and other information experts had not ever addressed the complexity of their document management. But the librarians were much worried about their collections than the documents they produced in exercising their functions. :)</p>
				<p>The project began with a consulting service with the goal of defining plans, politics and procedures in document management. And two years later we decided which software could be the best support to our Document Management System. When we chose an ECM software we thought about open source and ECM market recognition. So we chose Alfresco.</p>
				<p>One of our requirements was that Alfresco should be integrated into the Corporate Intranet because we think that our organization must provide to its staff a unique corporate platform to access the corporate knowledge. And also because we care about user experience. These requirements helped us to minimize the impact of the change.</p>
				<p>So we use Alfresco to support the Document Management System here in the Spanish National Library.</p>
				<p>At present, 32% of the staff uses Alfresco. Alfresco Share is improving the working groups. The most interesting feature for us is the ability to create workflows because it helps working groups to have less meetings and to work better, reaching their objectives.</p>
				<p>The problems we faced with are related to the usability. In most cases, we see that users don’t find Alfresco so intuitive and easy as we expected. So there is a big need for training employees.</p>
				<p>So we’d like that Alfresco will improve usability. I think that it need to be much more people-centered tool.</p>
				<p>I think that the level of use of Alfresco in Spanish National Library is very satisfactory and I hope we will extend Alfresco implementation to the rest of the staff soon.</p>
