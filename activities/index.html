					<img class="left" src="/assets/img/collaboration-bee.png"/>
					<p>Members of the Order like to build new Alfresco add-ons and to help newcomers to build their first add-on. For example, Lanre is keen on finishing the AAAR work he was collaborating on for the hackathon. Ole works on Alfresco Maven SDK. Jeff is one of the core cmislib mainainers. Oksana works on the JIRA-dashlet.</p>

						<li>search for a team that is looking for contributions</li>
						<li>ask for help with your first add-on</li>

					<img class="right" src="/assets/img/honeycomb-bee.png"/>
					<p>We maintain a list of our favorite free open source Alfresco add-ons. The add-ons that are included work on the latest releases and are those that many people find useful and interesting. We're picky about which add-ons we choose because we want to be able to help you use them on your projects.</p>
					<p>Maintaining the list involves:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>reviewing that an add-on works on the latest Alfresco versions</li>
						<li>categorizing add-ons</li>
						<li>collaborating with the add-on's developer when problems arise</li>
						<li>creating and reviewing tutorials and screenshots</li>

					<p>The homepage of the ADDONS committee and all details on how to add your add-on to the list can be found at <a href="https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/addons/wiki" target="_blank">Github Wiki</a>.</p>

					<img class="left" src="/assets/img/si-bee.png"/>
					<p>Many companies are looking for a team or a person who can implement a project based on Alfresco Community Edition. Or perhaps they need help to develop an extension or solve some specific task. Alfresco Software forbids partners to do paid work on Alfresco Community Edition, so it can be difficult to find an experienced, reliable team to help with Community Edition.</p>
					<p>To address this, we are forming a list of well-known systems integrators and freelancers all over the world who can help you with Community Edition.</p>
					<p>Want to help us form the list? Here's how:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you provide services: send us a link to your profile, tell us what you can do, and give us contacts of one or more customers who are willing to be a reference.</li>
						<li>If you are a customer: share your story and tell us who helped you with your Alfresco Community Edition project.</li>

					<p>Many companies use Alfresco Enterprise and Alfresco Software does a good job of telling their stories. But many organizations, large and small, use Alfresco Community Edition and they are happy with it. One of our goals is to tell their story.</p>
					<p>We want you to share your Alfresco Community Edition story with the rest of the world. What issues arose and how did you address them? Who helped you in hard times? What do you wish you had known when you first started out? <a href="#contact" href="smooth"><u>Contact us</u></a> using the Mailing list.</p>

					<p>We are working on creating Alfresco Honeycomb Edition. It will be based on Alfresco Community Edition and will include a combination of scripts, content models, workflows, extensions and patches.</p>
					<p>Alfresco Honeycomb Edition will include some of the most popular and useful add-ons that are available as well as a number of scripts that can be used to install Alfresco more quickly.</p>
					<p>We are not going to fork Alfresco to build our own product. The idea is to build a new package that will include the unmodified Alfresco Community Edition distribution and a number of scripts that will apply our changes to the system during the first start.</p>
